						<h2>Where were we?</h2>
						<p>Welcome to the reboot of the site that all Invader Zim fans have missed. As it is there is only one page but that will change soon. For now enjoy all the stuff I can cram onto one page.</p>

						<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
						<p>Well this site can grow or it can die. It can grow many different ways. And it all depends on you, the fans. This was once our favorite site for Invader Zim information. Our collected pot of information has grown since the site went down. It's up to you to bring it here. Check the Contact section in the side bar to find out how to send info.</p>

						<p>Also you can donate to help the site thrive.
